# Social Media - Trends and Stress Analysis

Our main goal with this research project is to analyze trends and relations of the psychological effects of using social media, with a particular focus on stress, depression, and anxiety. This question is important to us because social media's growing influence in modern society and our lives is coming to odds with a growing societal conciousness towards the value of stress balancing and mental health. To address this concern, we will do analysis of datasets containing Reddit posts, Twitter tweets, and survey responses.
