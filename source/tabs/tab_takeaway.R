     active users. However, as the younger generation such as Gen Z or Gen Alpha
     start becoming more active on their social platforms, we expect other apps
     such as Tiktok to retain a higher volume of users. Moreover, Tiktok currently 
     has the highest average screen time out of all the social media sites analyzed. 
     As a result, not only will social media users increase, but average screen time is bound to 
     increase as well."),
