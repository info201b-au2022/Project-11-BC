  come to play with the contributions of stress that is experienced when utilizing social media. Social media
  can be utilized in many different ways, whether it be for entertainment, for advocation, for social connection,
  or even to gain important information such as the news."),

  a stressor in an individual’s mental well being, it is always important to taken into account that with the
  various different ways social media can be utilized, different age groups interact with social media
  in different ways."),

  every day lives, where as the older generations may view social media as a negative or unimportant aspect
  of their lives. Because of the difference in which social media is viewed within the minds of the different
  age groups, social media may already be considered a stressor for individuals. For the younger generation,
  social media can be viewed as a way to cope with their mental wellbeing, and may view the power of social
  media as a positive environment, whereas the older generation may view social media as a waste of time and
  overall just a stressful environment to be in."),

  perspectives on social media, it must be considered that stress from social media can indeed be influenced
  with presumed perspectives. It was reflected within the findings that a significant number of individuals
  had responded that social media had neither a purely positive or negative impact on their mental wellbeing.
  For the Generation Z and the Millennial group, social media is viewed as convenient way to gain information
  and socialize, some stressors from social media for this group may come from the content they are receiving
  such as sensitive topics of on going affairs, but overall, social media for these age groups is used as a
  means to connect and share what is going on in their lives. This is again a reflection of the majority’s
  perspective, the Generation Z and the Millennial group that has moreover a positive view on the utilization of
  social media, as it is a vital part of their everyday lives."),

  to take into account. It was recognized that when taking information from the dataset it was crucial to remember
  that a cultural aspect had an impact on the information that was received and stated. With the topic of the
  correlation of stress and social media, and the specific data that was retrieved for the findings, there was a
  demographic bias. Thus meaning that the demographic in which the data was retrieved from was coming from mostly
  the Generation X and the Millennial age group. More so specifically, the retrieved findings from the data is more
  of a reflection of the correlation of stress and social media on the Generation X and Millennial group, not a
  reflection of all individuals who utilize social media. With the findings, it is important to emphasize that
  different perspectives are held about social media when comparing different age groups. For example, Generation
  X and Millennial groups find that social media holds a significant importance to their everyday lives and often
  viewed as a positive way to connect with others, and that older generation groups may look at social media as a
  daunting platform which is complex and stressful in their perspectives. With different perspectives on the importance
  and influence of social media, it is important to consider that the factors that contribute to stress experienced
  as a result of social media also differ from generation to generation. For example, stress gained from social media
  can look for a Generation X individual compared to a Baby Boomer individual. For an individual from the Generation X
  era, the presence of social media has been present for almost half of their lives and view social media as a platform
   to socialize. For Generation x individuals social media plays a vital part in their lives, as most of their
   information and connection with others is through the internet, as well as utilize social media as their main
   source of news. On the other hand, for Baby Boomers, social media has not been a vital part of their lives,
   not many of the Baby Boomer population will utilize social media in general, and will most likely utilize
   social media only for entertainment purposes and to just share content about their lives. Therefore, when
   considering whether or not stress really does or does not have a correlation with social media, the
   perspectives of different age groups and demographic bias must always be considered when looking at the
   data sets."),
