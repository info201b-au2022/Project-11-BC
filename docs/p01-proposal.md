#### The Dataset

#### Expected Implications

There are many implications that can be discerned concerning the results of our research question, which aims to see the ties between social media usage and stress. Before talking about the implications, we should mention the expected results of the research question. I would expect there to be a correlation between social media and stress, whether it be social media that begets stress or social media being used as a way to vent stress.

Assuming that this ends up being the case, the primary implication for policymakers and people is that the policies in place for reducing stress and negativity at social media apps may not be sufficient. Policymakers involved in social media should know to dedicate resources to think of ways to potentially reduce this stress. Someone looking at the results of this project may be able to divert resources to either fixing social media policies that may be a source of this stress or make improvements to mental health infrastructure.

We hope the results from this research can be used to better guide and improve the experience people get on social media.
