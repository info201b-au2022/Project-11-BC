#Stress Detection and Analysis in Popular Social Media Platforms

##Summary Paragraph

## ACCESSING THE /source DIRECTORY
### Example 1: Source some code and run a function
```{r}
# Example 1: Note relative path, which can be read: Up one
# directory(..), down into source (/source), and 
# then "source" an R file (data_access.R)
source("../source/data_access.R")
data_access_test()
```

### Example 2: Initialize a variable and then use it
```{r}
# Example 1: This function was "sourced" above
msg <- data_access_test(" Morgan!")
```

> `r msg` Hope you have a good day!! 

## ABOUT THIS FILE: 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Plots

###ScatterPlot
```{r}
chart1
```
This scatterplot shows the average tone quantified in a numerical value from 10 different subreddits. Here, the tone is quantified in a way that a higher numerical value correlates with a "more positive" tone. Whereas, a lower numerical value correlates with a "more negative tone". Possible tone ranges range from 0 to 100. From the graph, we see that the subreddit "food_pantry" has the highest tone, meaning that the least amount of stress was detected in it. On the other hand, subreddits such as "stress" and "domesticviolence" had the lowest tone, meaning that a lot more stress was detected from there. 

###Plot 2

###Plot3

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
